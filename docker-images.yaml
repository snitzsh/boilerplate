# TODO:
#   - helm-chart version should the same as [package.json .Cargo.toml] version
#     and [git and image] tag_name should match the verion.
#   - make aws api call to get ec2 image version, or any registry. That way
#     we can handle the next version.
#
# NOTE:
#   - follows the sames docker-composer/values.yaml structure
#   - It follows the folder structure. Ex:
#     /uis/snitzsh/main-rust
#   - Image may belong to multiple helm-charts.
#   - Since a helm-chart is not attach to helm-chart-.*-configs projects and a
#     helm-chart-.*-configs is not attached to specific image, this is
#     independent and will build a new image regardless if its deployed to a
#     cluster.
